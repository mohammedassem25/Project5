# Project5
Here, we will learn about how to make different visualizations using the R programming language. 
The project is called Uber Data Analysis in R. Firstly, we need to install some important packages that 
we will use during the analysis of our project. When I started to upload our data into a data frame, I found 
that we had about 4.5 million rows for that I thought to filter our data to decrease huge amounts of data. Here, 
I used the !duplicated function between Date.Time column & Base column to remove any duplicated data and then 
decrease the total number of rows. Then, I got the summary of our data found that Date.Time column type needs to be changed.
After that, I saw that we needed some new columns e.g. month, day, day of week, hour, minute, and second. Finally, I started 
to make different visualizations that give us plenty of details about our data.
